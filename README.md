# Movie Website - Udacity Project

The Movies Website is a single page, dynamic web page showing some of my favorite movies, featuring six tiles that play movie trailer one clicked. The website was developed as part of Udacity's full stack web developer nanodegree program. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installing

In order to run the website on your local machine, you will need the following:
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/). Should be preinstalled for Mac users. Run ```python --version``` on your terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) to verify
- Clone or download this repository to your machine. For example: ```git clone https://github.com/nganani/Movies-Project```
- On terminal/command prompt, move to the newly created folder 'Movies-Project', using ```cd Movies-Project```
- Using ```ls``` (Mac), or ```dir``` (Windows), ensure the folder contains the following files:

```
.gitignore
entertainment_center.py
fresh_tomatoes.py
media.py
Movie-Project-1.png
README.md
```
Please note that ```.gitignore``` may not show up, as on Mac OS-X for example, files starting with ```.``` are hidden by default

### Running the site

In order to test run the movie site, run ```python entertainment_center.py``` while you are in the ```Movies-Project``` folder. 

Your default browser should open with the following page showing:
